A simple animation of planets moving in their orbital trajectories.

If two planets collide, the smaller one will split in two. The children will then start neighbouring orbital paths. 
Collision are shown as purple circles. If planets become too small they become extinct and are removed.

A running list of entities and their orbital radii are shown on the left. 

More planets can be added by pressing the `A` key.
